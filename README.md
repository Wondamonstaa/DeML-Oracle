# DeML-Oracle

# 🔮 DeML Oracle – Decentralized Machine Learning Oracle Network

> A hybrid system that bridges smart contracts and machine learning to provide decentralized, trustworthy, and verifiable AI-powered insights on-chain.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**DeML Oracle** enables smart contracts to consume **machine learning model predictions** in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. ML providers stake tokens and respond to prediction requests, while on-chain logic aggregates, verifies, and rewards accurate predictions.

This project combines the power of:
- 🧠 Off-chain Machine Learning (Python, PyTorch, etc.)
- ⛓️ On-chain Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- 🔗 Decentralized Infrastructure (Chainlink, IPFS, The Graph)

---

## 🧩 Use Case Examples

- 🛡️ **Wallet Risk Scoring:** Classify wallets based on transaction behavior (fraud, sybil risk, etc.).
- 🔍 **Scam Detection:** ML models analyze contract bytecode to detect likely scams.
- 💬 **Sentiment-Aware DeFi:** Use off-chain sentiment analysis to adjust yield strategies.
- 🗳️ **DAO Governance:** Recommend or optimize proposals via reinforcement learning.
